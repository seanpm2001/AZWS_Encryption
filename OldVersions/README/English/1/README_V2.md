# AZWS encryption

## Formerly known as "One to the side typing"

AZWS encryption is very weak encryption for plain text documents. It involves writing 1 letter to the side (it is designed for QWERTY, but also works on other layouts when specified)

For example, H can be either H, G, Y, U, B, or N

You have to manually decipher each letter based on the word, context, memory of the writer, and the sentence. If done incorrectly, it cannot be translated by anyone, even the creator.

It is not the best encryption system and is not recommended at all for security, it is a form of writing I have developed

**Just to clarify:**

DO NOT USE THIS AS YOUR PRIMARY OR SECONDARY ENCRYPTION METHOD. ONLY USE IT FOR PERSONAL NEEDS.

This encryption is incredibly easy to break, even by a 1950s computer. Please use SHA256 or better instead. This system is only designed for personal use.

Since I have now specified the method, the method is now halfway obsolete. It will be rendered 100% obsolete if source code examples can decipher any AZWS encrypted document, and somehow figure out the context and memory gap.

## Why did you publish this

I have been using this system for about a year, and I decided to publish the idea. It also would be a great basic algorithm challenge for computer programming.

I intend to keep this as a programming challenge, to see how this encryption can be broken in as many programming languages as possible, and in as many programming styles as possible.
